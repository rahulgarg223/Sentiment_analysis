# Sentiment_Classification_G12

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using various machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of tweets collected from Twitter, labeled with sentiments such as positive, negative, or neutral. 

## Techniques Used
- Complement Naive Bayes
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Vanilla Naive Bayes
- Naive Bayes with custom modifications

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a collection of tweets along with their corresponding sentiment labels. It has been preprocessed and prepared for analysis in all the files that are included.
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset). It contains a collection of tweets along with their corresponding sentiment labels.

## Implementation
Each technique is implemented using Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The code is organized into separate modules for clarity and ease of understanding.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries specified in the kernels of each file.
3. Run the individual scripts for each technique.
4. Analyze the results and compare the performance of different techniques.
